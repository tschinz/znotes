Insights from the book [The subtle way to not giving a fuck](https://www.google.de/books/edition/Die_subtile_Kunst_des_Daraufschei%C3%9Fens/A0-HDQAAQBAJ) by MArk Manson.

+ **Choose for what you want to care about** - You can’t care about everything. Carefully select what deserves your attention and energy, focusing on values that align with your goals and identity.
+ **Happiness Comes from Solving Problems** - Life is full of challenges, and true happiness comes from engaging in meaningful problem-solving. Avoiding problems or seeking constant positivity leads to frustration.
+ **You’re Not Special** - Accepting that you are not inherently unique or exceptional is liberating. It allows you to focus on realistic growth rather than entitlement or inflated expectations.
+ **Take Responsibility for Your Life** - While you cannot control everything that happens to you, you can control how you respond. Owning your choices and reactions empowers you to lead a better life.
+ **Rejection is Necessary** - Setting boundaries and saying no to things that don’t align with your values is essential for prioritizing what truly matters.
+ **Certainty is Overrated** - Embrace uncertainty and be willing to question your beliefs. Growth comes from recognizing that you might be wrong and continuously striving to improve.
+ **Death is the Ultimate Motivator** - Contemplating mortality clarifies what’s truly important. By recognizing life’s brevity, you can focus on leaving a meaningful impact.
+ **Good Values vs. Bad Values** - Good values are reality-based, internally controlled, and socially constructive. Bad values are superficial, externally influenced, and destructive (e.g., fame, wealth).

**Core Message**

To live a meaningful life, focus on fewer, better things. Stop wasting energy on trivialities and align your actions with your deepest values.
