# Welcome to my (0,0,0)

This webpage is a compilation of knowledge I’ve pursued and documented over the years. It is a living project — a work in progress that does not need perfection, but reflects my passion for learning and sharing insights.

Through experience, I’ve discovered that crafting summaries and cheat sheets is the most effective way to master and retain new knowledge. This approach forms the foundation of this knowledge base.

The journey began on paper in 1999 and transitioned to a webpage in 2004. Over the years, it has transformed alongside my learning process:

- ZWiki was its first iteration, embodying simplicity and collaboration.
- Znotes came next, focusing on personal, well-organized knowledge.
- Now, as Zentauri, it symbolizes a constellation of interconnected insights — a map of learning inspired by the stars.

Feel free to explore the content. If it proves helpful to others, that’s an added bonus. Thank you for visiting my evolving archive of understanding.
