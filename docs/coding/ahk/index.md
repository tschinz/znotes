# Introduction

AutoHotkey is a free, open source macro-creation and automation software utility which allows users to automate repetitive tasks. Any application user interface can be modified by AutoHotkey. It is driven by a custom scripting language called AHK that is aimed specifically at providing keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys.

# My Scripts
My ahk scripts can be found in the [config_repo]({{config_repo}}/tree/master/scripts/ahk)
