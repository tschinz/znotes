# VHDL

![](img/logo.svg){.center width="20%"}

## Introduction

VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) is a hardware description language used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as field-programmable gate arrays and integrated circuits.

VHDL is commonly used to write text models that describe a logic circuit. Such a model is processed by a synthesis program. A simulation program is used to test the logic design using simulation models to represent the logic circuits that interface to the design. This collection of simulation models is commonly called a testbench.

VHDL has constructs to handle the parallelism inherent in hardware designs. VHDL is strongly typed and is not case sensitive.

A final point is that when a VHDL model is translated into the "gates and wires" that are mapped onto a programmable logic device such as a CPLD or FPGA, then it is the actual hardware being configured, rather than the VHDL code being "executed" as if on some form of a processor chip.

As last remark I want to thank Corthay Francois for his VHDL Summary and HTML files.
