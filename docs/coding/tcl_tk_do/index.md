## Introduction

Tcl originally from "Tool Command Language" is a scripting language. It is commonly used for rapid prototyping, scripted applications, GUIs and testing. Tcl is used on embedded systems platforms.

Tcl is also used for CGI scripting. Tcl is popularly used today in many automated test harnesses, both for software and hardware, and has a loyal following in the Network Testing and SQA communities.
