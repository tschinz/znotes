# Introduction

Typst is a markup-based typesetting system for the sciences. It is designed to be an alternative both to advanced tools like LaTeX and simpler tools like Word and Google Docs. Typst provides a lightweight markup syntax for common layout tasks, as well as set and show rules for styling documents easily and automatically.

Typst is a good choice for writing any long-form text, such as essays, articles, scientific papers, books, reports, and homework assignments. It is also a great fit for any documents containing mathematical notation, such as papers in the math, physics, and engineering fields. Finally, due to its strong styling and automation features, Typst is an excellent choice for any set of documents that share a common style, such as a book series.
